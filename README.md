# 1. Information Security vs Cybersecurity

- These two terms are used interchangeably all the time.
- **Cybersecurity** deals specifically with protecting your data from **cyber threats**.
- T hreats that exist on the internet threats that exist in the cyber world.
- But when you're talking about **Information Security**.
  - It's all about protecting your data.

# 2. CIA

- These are the three fundamental pillars of cybersecurity and cyber crime in general (CIA).

## 2.1. Confidentiality

- Ensuring that data is private and accessed only by those with permission to do so.
- Can be achieved with the use of passwords, biometrics, 2FA, MFA and encryption.

## 2.2. Integrity

- Ensuring that data has not been altered or tampered in any way.
- Can be achieved through the use of **hashing** or **checksums** and **access control**.

## 2.3. Availability

- Ensuring that data is always available for access and use.
- Can be achieved through the use of **backups**, **maintenance** & **disaster recovery plans**.

# 3. DAD

- DAD is basically the exact opposite of CIA.

## 3.1. Disclosure

- Data is accessed by non-authoried users.
- Trojans, brute force attacks, theft.

## 3.2. Alteration

- Data has been compromised or tampered with Malware, viruses, SQL Injection.

## 3.3. Deniability

- Access to data and resources are blocked
- Denial of Service Attacks (DDOs), Ransomware.

# 4. Computer protocols



# 5. Basic terminologies

- Below are some of the main terminologies that you should be aware about in the world of computer and network security:
  - Blacklist - Used to refer to a list of banned IP addresses, applications or users.
  - Whitelist - The exact opposite of a blacklist.
  - Cat fishing - The process of creating a fake online profile in order to trick people into believing they are someone else for financial gain.
  - Authentication - The process of proving an individual is who they claim to be.
  - Data Mining - The activity of analyzing and/or searching through data in order to find items of relevance, significance or value.
  - Threat - This generally refers to anything that has the potential to cause our data, systems and networks harm.
  - Exploit - A clearly defined way to breach the security of a system.
  - Vulnerabilities - These are weaknesses within a system or network that can be exploited to cause us harm.
  - Risk - This refers to the likelihood of something bad happening. A risk requires both a threat and a vulnerability to exist.
  - Zero Day - This is used to describe a threat that is unknown to security specialists and has not been addressed.
  - Hack Value - This describes a target that may attract an above average level of attention from an attacker.
  - Non-Repudiation - This is the concept that once an action is carried out by a party it cannot be denied by that same party.
  - Logic Bomb - A malicious code that is only triggered when a set of conditions are met.
  - Obfuscation - A term used to describe the tactic of making code unclear so that humans or programs like an antivirus cannot understand it.
  - Honey Pot - A decoy or trap for hackers.
  - Spoof - The act of falsifying the identity of the source of a communication or interaction.
